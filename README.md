For my own sanity, and perhaps to help yours as well, this is a summary of current Swift (Swift 2.1). The repo contains two playgrounds.

Both these playgrounds are commented with markdown. If the playgrounds don't look pretty in Xcode, find "Show Rendered Markup" in the "Editor" (not "Edit") menu and turn it on. If you are seeing the rendered markup, but you want to see or edit the raw file, in the same menu, find "Show Raw Markup" and turn that on.

1. [Basics (variables, typealiases, optionals, operators, tuples, enums, control flow, arrays, sets, dictionaries)](./SwiftCheatSheet-Basics.playground/Contents.swift). I have pretty much completed this cheat sheet.
2. [The TrickyStuff (structs, classes, protocols, functions, closures)](./SwiftCheatSheet-TheTrickyStuff.playground/Contents.swift). So far, this cheat sheet is just a placeholder!
