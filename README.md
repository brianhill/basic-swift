This playground was developed with Xcode 7.2.1 and is compatible with Swift 2.1.

This playground is commented with markdown. If it doesn't look pretty in Xcode, find "Show Rendered Markup" in the "Editor" (not "Edit") menu and turn it on. If you are seeing the rendered markup, but you want to see or edit the raw file, in the same menu, find "Show Raw Markup" and turn that on.

The [Basic Playground](./BasicSwift.playground/Contents.swift) includes variables, typealiases, optionals, operators, tuples, enums, control flow, and the basic features of arrays, sets, dictionaries. For anything you want more detail on, just jump to the corresponding material in [Apple's Swift Book](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/the-swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11) (may redirect to iTunes or iBooks).
