Course Home Page: http://physics.stmarys-ca.edu/classes/CS190_S16/index.html.

1. [Basics (variables, operators, tuples, arrays, sets, dictionaries)](./SwiftCheatSheetPartI.playground/Contents.swift)
2. [The Rest (structs, classes, protocols, functions)](./SwiftCheatSheetPartII.playground/Contents.swift)
